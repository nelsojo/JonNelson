        <h1>Basic Vulnerability Scanning Using Captured Packets</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Analyzing network traffic is essential for identifying security vulnerabilities and unauthorized activity within an organization.
                My goal was to demonstrate how simple tools can be created using built-in or easily accessible libraries to scan and filter packet capture (pcap) files.
                These files, recorded at network borders, provide valuable insights into protocol usage, traffic routing, and potential security risks.
                By leveraging packet captures from online sources and my home network, I developed a series of scripts that utilize the <code>tshark</code> API to analyze network traffic efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since <code>tshark</code> uses the same filtering syntax as Wireshark’s GUI, I chose it for its familiarity and ease of use in extracting critical packet information.
                My tool was designed in two formats: a single script that performs all necessary tasks in one run and a modular version consisting of four separate scripts, each addressing a specific security concern.
                This modular approach allows for more focused analysis, helping security professionals pinpoint potential risks such as outdated protocols, unauthorized scans, or unexpected port activity.
            </p>

        <h2>Network Traffic Analysis & Security Tools</h2>
        <p>I developed several BASH-based network scanning tools leveraging the tshark API to analyze packet capture files for security insights. These tools demonstrate my proficiency in scripting, network security analysis, and protocol filtering.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Protocol-Specific Packet Scanner</h3>
        <p>Built <code>scan1.sh</code> to filter traffic by protocol (FTP, Telnet, SSL) from packet capture files.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Validated outputs against Wireshark’s GUI and predefined capture files.</li>
            <li>Used Wireshark display filters and tshark commands for accurate filtering.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Security Applications:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Security Engineers:</strong> Identifies outdated or insecure protocols.</li>
            <li><strong>For Hackers:</strong> Helps locate exploitable network protocols.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Port-Protocol Mismatch Detector</h3>
        <p>Developed <code>scan2.sh</code> to detect unexpected traffic on well-known ports (22, 80, 53).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tested using Packet Sender and validated results with Wireshark.</li>
            <li>To demonstrate the tool will find packets to ports 22, 80, and 53 that are not of the type SSH, HTTP, or DNS I needed a 
                capture file that contains traffic where a connection to the ports mentioned is attempted for traffic of a different type 
                then is expected at that port.</li>
            <li>Revealed security misconfigurations and potential exploit entry points.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> 3: TLS Version Detection</h2>
        <p><code>scan3.sh</code> is a BASH tool that identifies TLS 1.0 and 1.1 usage in a network capture file.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Filters packets to report outdated TLS versions while ignoring TLS 1.2 and 1.3.</li>
            <li>Observed cases where packets mislabeled as TLS 1.3 actually used TLS 1.0.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h2> 4: ARP Request Detection</h2>
        <p><code>scan4.sh</code> analyzes ARP traffic to detect network scanning activity.</p>
        <p>Obviously, Wireshark detects 
            when a device sends an ARP request in a packet, and with arp-scan I was sending an ARP request to every device on the 
            network. Often, many times in a row. So, I thought it would be useful to have a tool that counts the number of ARP 
            requests that are being sent from each IP address on a network because high counts would indicate someone (like me) is 
            scanning the network.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Counts ARP requests from each IP and flags those exceeding 100 requests.</li>
            <li>Demonstrated high ARP traffic when running <code>arp-scan</code> in a Kali VM.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Here we explored various techniques for analyzing open ports, identifying running services, and detecting insecure traffic on a network.
                Building on these foundational skills, I demonstrated how attackers can exploit misconfigurations, such as services running on unexpected ports or outdated protocols, to gain unauthorized access.
                A key takeaway is that moving services to uncommon ports is not a robust security measure but rather an obscurity tactic that provides minimal protection.
            </p>
            <p>
                The combination of open port scanning and packet filtering highlights how easily an insider or an attacker can gather intelligence on a network’s infrastructure.
                While using non-standard ports may indicate a hardened system, it can also introduce unintended security risks if not properly configured.
                The insights gained from this project reinforce the importance of proactive network monitoring and the need for layered security beyond simple port manipulation.
